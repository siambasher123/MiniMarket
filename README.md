## Project Description

Mini Marketplace is a web-based application that allows:

- Admins -> can manage the whole marketplace , can see all products available in the marketplace , can add coupon ( edit/delete) ,manage users
- Sellers -> can add, update, delete products and view orders.
- Buyers -> can browse products, place orders, and apply coupons.

The application is developed with Spring Boot, Java, and Maven, and uses PostgreSQL for data persistence. Additionally, it features Git-based CI/CD pipelines, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for clean data handling, and comprehensive unit and integration tests.

---

## Architecture

The project follows a standard Spring Boot layered architecture:

1. Controller Layer – Handles HTTP requests and routes them to services.
2. Service Layer – Implements business logic.
3. Repository Layer – Interacts with the database.
4. Model Layer – Represents entities and data structures.

## ER Diagram

The database structure consists of the following key entities:

- User – Represents Admin, Buyer, Seller
- Product – Added by Seller
- Order – Placed by Buyer
- Coupon – Managed by Admin

## Render Deployment

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with the mini-marketplace code
- Render account (https://render.com)
- PostgreSQL database ready (Render managed or external)

### Steps

1. **Connect Your Repository to Render**
   - Go to Render dashboard → New + → Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the branch to deploy (e.g., `main`)

2. **Configure Web Service**
   - **Name**: `mini-marketplace`
   - **Environment**: Docker
   - **Dockerfile**: `Dockerfile` (default)
   - **Build Command**: `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests` (or leave empty, Docker handles it)
   - **Start Command**: Leave empty (uses ENTRYPOINT from Dockerfile)

3. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
   - In Render dashboard, create a new PostgreSQL database service
   - Note the connection details (host, port, user, password)
   - Or use an external database and save the `DATABASE_URL`

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Go to Web Service settings → Environment
   - Add the following variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string (auto-provided if using Render Postgres)
     - `JDBC_DATABASE_URL`: Same as `DATABASE_URL` or custom format
     - `JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME`: Database user
     - `JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Database password
     - `PORT`: `8080` (optional, Render sets this)
     - `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`: `production` (optional)

5. **Link Database to Web Service** (if using Render Postgres)
   - In Web Service environment settings, link the Postgres service
   - Render auto-injects connection details

6. **Deploy**
   - Save and return to Web Service dashboard → Manual Deploy
   - Or enable Auto-Deploy on push for CI/CD

7. **Verify**
   - Wait for build and deployment to complete
   - Visit your app URL: `https://mini-marketplace-ympg.onrender.com`
   - Test login, signup, and dashboard flows

### Environment Variables for Render

| Variable                 | Source                   | Required |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`           | Render Postgres          | Yes      |
| `JDBC_DATABASE_URL`      | Same or custom           | No       |
| `JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME` | Render Postgres          | Yes      |
| `JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Render Postgres          | Yes      |
| `PORT`                   | Auto (8080)              | No       |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | Optional (default: none) | No       |

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set and database is running
- **Port binding error**: Ensure `PORT` env var is set (Render provides it automatically)
- **Build fails**: Check logs → mvn clean package command and Dockerfile
- **App starts but no connection**: Ensure Postgres service is linked or DATABASE_URL is correct

## CI/CD Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Checkout Code**: Clones the repository
2. **Setup JDK 17**: Configures Java 17 with Temurin distribution
3. **Cache Maven Dependencies**: Speeds up builds by caching Maven packages
4. **Run Tests**: Executes unit and integration tests with `./mvnw test`
5. **Build Application**: Packages the application with `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests`
6. **Build Docker Image**: Creates a Docker image for deployment

### Deployment

- **Automatic Deployment**: Render auto-deploys on push to `main` branch
- **Manual Deployment**: Can be triggered from Render dashboard
- **Environment**: Production deployment uses environment variables for configuration

---

## Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality and automated deployment:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Push/PR to main] --> B[GitHub Actions CI]
    B --> C[Run Tests]
    C --> D[Build JAR]
    D --> E[Build Docker Image]
    E --> F[Deploy to Render]
    F --> G[Live Application]
```

**Pipeline Benefits:**

- Automated testing prevents bugs
- Consistent builds across environments
- Fast feedback on code changes
- Seamless deployment to production

---

## Branch Strategy

This project follows a simple Git branching strategy:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code, auto-deploys to Render
- **Feature Branches**: For new features, named `feature/description`
- **Bugfix Branches**: For bug fixes, named `bugfix/issue-description`

**Workflow:**

1. Create feature/bugfix branch from `main`
2. Develop and commit changes
3. Push branch and create pull request
4. CI runs tests on PR
5. Merge to `main` after review
6. Auto-deployment triggers
